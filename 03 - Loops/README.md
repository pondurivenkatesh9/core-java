# Loops:
###	Need For Loop
    avoid code repetition
###	While Loop
    while(i<=4)
    {
        System.out.println("Hi"+ i);
        i++;
    }
    System.out.println("Bye"+i);
###	Do While Loop
    int i=1;
    do
    {
        System.out.println("Hi"+i);
        i++;
    }
    while(i<=4);
###	For Loop
    for(int i=0;i<=4;i++)
    {
        System.out.println("Hi"+i);
    }
###	Which Loop To Use
    For loop:
    If you know how many iterations you want to go for loop
    (intiliazing vaue, condition, increment or decrement)

    While loop:
    When you need to read the file go for while loop, if the number of iterations is not known.

    - For loop can also be used as a while.
    
    Do While Loop:-
    If you condition get false but you want to exceute the code at least once.
